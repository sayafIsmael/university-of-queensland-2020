The further combination of the ICT, business, and management skills is currently a sine qua non requirement for candidates seeking employment in the ICT industry. The job market is changing; the demand for pure IT/CS jobs (software engineering, database management, network management, etc) is diminishing while the demand for IT professionals with good business and management skills is growing.","unitList":[]}],"isAvailableOnline":{},"campuses":[],"courseFees":[],"institutionSpecificData":{},"courseLink":"https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/program.html?acad_prog=5523"},{"courseId":"UQ-1604936499417","courseName":"Master of Conservation Biology","courseCode":"5551","cricosCode":"077443C","studyArea":"Conservation Biology (24 units)","courseLevel":"Postgraduate Coursework","courseStudyModes":[{"studyMode":"Full-time","duration":"1 Year"}],"totalCreditPoints":"NA","courseUnits":[{"unitType":"Common Units (24)","creditPoints":"NA","description":"The Master of Conservation Biology is an ideal program if you wish to expand your career prospects into a wide range of government, conservation and resource management agencies.

The Graduate Diploma in Environmental Health Sciences (GDipEnvHlthSc) is an interdisciplinary program that teaches courses relevant to environmental health practice; it is a collaboration between UQ School of Public Health and the Queensland Alliance for Environmental Health Sciences, an internationally renowned research centre incorporating the former National Research Centre for Environmental Toxicology (Entox). This one-year program aims to equip public health professionals with knowledge and skills to address complex environmental health challenges. Such challenges require graduates to develop anticipatory and integrated responses, which in turn rely on an understanding of the interrelationship among risk factors related to a broad range of hazards and contexts, skills in coordination across sectors and jurisdictions, and risk communication with communities, the private sector and government agencies.","unitList":[]}],"isAvailableOnline":{},"campuses":[],"courseFees":[],"institutionSpecificData":{},"courseLink":"https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/program.html?acad_prog=5705"},{"courseId":"UQ-1604936703694","courseName":"Graduate Diploma in Environmental Management","courseCode":"5084","cricosCode":"008458A","studyArea":"Environmental Management","courseLevel":"Postgraduate Coursework","courseStudyModes":[{"studyMode":"Full-time","duration":"1 Year"}],"totalCreditPoints":"NA","courseUnits":[{"unitType":"Common Units (16)","creditPoints":"NA","description":"Environmental Management is the planning and implementation of actions geared to improve the quality of the human environment.\nThe postgraduate programs in environmental management at the University of Queensland are multidisciplinary programs designed to enhance the skills and technical expertise of graduates working in all facets of the environmental arena.

Coupled with population growth, globalisation, and climate change, the potential for emerging or re-emerging environmental health risks and threats to human health puts governments, industry and communities under pressure to adapt and apply sustainable solutions. The Master of Environmental Health Sciences (MEnvHlthSc) is an interdisciplinary program that teaches courses relevant to environmental health practice and research. The program is a collaboration between UQ School of Public Health and the Queensland Alliance for Environmental Health Sciences, an internationally renowned research centre incorporating the former National Research Centre for Environmental Toxicology (Entox). The MEnvHlthSc aims to develop public health leaders who can effectively manage complex environmental health challenges. Such challenges require graduates to be skilled in developing anticipatory and integrated responses, which in turn rely on an understanding of the interrelationship among risk factors related to a broad range of hazards and contexts, skills in coordination across sectors and jurisdictions, as well as risk communication with communities, the private sector and government agencies.","unitList":[]}],"isAvailableOnline":{},"campuses":[],"courseFees":[],"institutionSpecificData":{},"courseLink":"https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/program.html?acad_prog=5704"},{"courseId":"UQ-1604936852552","courseName":"Master of Environmental Management","courseCode":"5174","cricosCode":"006689B","studyArea":"Environmental Management (24 units)","courseLevel":"Postgraduate Coursework","courseStudyModes":[{"studyMode":"Full-time","duration":"1.5 Years"}],"totalCreditPoints":"NA","courseUnits":[{"unitType":"Common Units (24)","creditPoints":"NA","description":"Environmental Management is the planning and implementation of actions geared to improve the quality of the human environment.\nThe postgraduate programs in environmental management at the University of Queensland are multidisciplinary programs designed to enhance the skills and technical expertise of graduates working in all facets of the environmental arena.
